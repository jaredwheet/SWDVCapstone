# Baby Tracker
I created Baby Tracker for my capstone project for my Masters in Software Development at Maryville University.  Baby tracker is for new parents who want to track their baby's eating, sleeping and vitals.  This is a very simple input application, meant to take some of stress away from being a new parent. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

If you use NPM i to install the node modules, you will have everything you need. 

## Deployment

I have deployed this app to heroku.  You can visit the application at https://baby-tracker-capstone-2019.herokuapp.com/
