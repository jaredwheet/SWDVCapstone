# Baby Tracker

This application is being developed for my MS in Software Development at Maryville University.

The intent of this application is to allow new parents an easy to use application to track their baby's eating and sleeping habits.  This is important as they bring the newborn home and can provide valuable data insights.  Being a newborn parent can be very stressful, and this is intended to reduce some of the stress.

I will be using the github projects attached to this repo as my scrum board as I work through building the applciation.
